In Python, a Thread Pool is a group of idle threads pre-instantiated and are ever ready to be given the task.

We can either instantiate new threads for each or use Python Thread Pool for new threads. But when the number of tasks is way more than Python Thread Pool is preferred over the former method.

A thread pool can manage parallel execution of a large number of threads as follows: –

    1. A thread can be reused if a thread in a thread pool completes its execution.
    2. A new thread is created to replace a thread that is terminated.

为什么要用线程池:
    使用线程池可以有效地控制系统中并发线程的数量。当系统中包含有大量的并发线程时，会导致系统性能急剧下降，甚至导致 Python 解释器崩溃，而线程池的最大线程数参数可以控制系统中并发线程的数量不超过此数。
